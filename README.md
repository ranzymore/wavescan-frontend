1. User Registration and Authentication
   Users must be able to register for an account using an email address and password, or via social login (Google, Facebook, etc.).
   Implement user authentication (login/logout) to protect user data.
   Allow password reset functionality.

2. Menu Creation
   Users should be able to create a custom menu by adding categories (e.g., appetizers, drinks, desserts).
   Users must be able to add, edit, and delete menu items, including:
   Item name
   Description
   Price
   Image (optional)

   Enable drag-and-drop functionality to reorder items within categories.

4. QR-Code Generation
   Generate a unique QR code for each user's menu.
   The QR code should link to a dynamically generated web page that displays the menu.
   Allow users to download and print the QR code for sharing with customers.

5. Menu Sharing
   Provide a unique URL for each menu that users can share with their customers.
   When the QR code is scanned, customers should be directed to a mobile-friendly page displaying the latest version of the menu.
   Allow users to share the link to their menu via email, social media, or embedding it on their website.

6. Menu Updates
   Any changes made to the menu (e.g., adding or removing items, changing prices) should automatically update the live menu that customers access via the QR code.
   Notify users if a menu has been successfully updated.

7. Analytics Dashboard
   Provide users with analytics to track how often their QR codes are scanned.
   Show the number of menu views and track customer preferences for menu items (optional).

8. Design Customization
   Allow users to customize the appearance of their menu (e.g., colors, fonts, layout) to align with their branding.
   Provide template options for different types of businesses (restaurants, cafes, bars).

9. Mobile Responsiveness
   Ensure the dynamic menu is mobile-friendly so customers can easily browse items from their phones after scanning the QR code.
   Support viewing the menu on tablets and desktop devices as well.

10. Search and Filters
    Allow customers to search for specific items on the menu.
    Add filters for dietary requirements (e.g., vegan, gluten-free) or item types (e.g., drinks, meals).

11. Admin Panel
    Provide an admin dashboard for users to manage their menu, QR code, and analytics.
    Include features to manage multiple locations (if applicable) or menu versions (e.g., brunch vs. dinner menu).

12. Security and Privacy
    Ensure user data (including menus) is securely stored.
    Implement HTTPS and data encryption for secure customer access to menus.

13. Integration with Existing Systems
    Allow integration with existing POS (point-of-sale) systems or inventory management platforms, so menu availability is updated in real-time.
